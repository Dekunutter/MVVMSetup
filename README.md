# MVVM Setup
Very basic MVVM project, showing basic setup of Android MVVM architecture using lifecycle extensions for live data and RxJava for observables
The app itself is just three incredibly basic activities, building up into a rudementary calorie counter

- The splash screen loads the stored user information from Shared Preferences and navigates us to the next activity accordingly
- The initializer screen gives us an input field to set our desired daily calorie intake
- The counter screen provides a button for tracking your current calorie intake

 Very much an MVVM example that is a work in progress. The overall feature set is still incredibly simple
