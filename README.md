# MVVM Setup
Very basic MVVM project, showing basic setup of Android MVVM architecture using lifecycle observables
The app itself if just a single activity with a button that, when pressed increments a counter. This counter value is reflected by a textview on the UI by observing on mutable livedata stored in the viewmodel

The project has many imports but currently this is just an exmaple of MVVM using the Android lifecycle extensions API.
